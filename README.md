Media Queries: Applied media queries to adjust styles based on the screen width. Breakpoints were set at 768px for tablets and 480px for mobile devices. 
Flexible Images: Ensured images are responsive by setting their width to a percentage and using max-width: 100%; to prevent overflow.
Fluid Grid Layout: Utilized a fluid grid layout for the features section, allowing the boxes to wrap and adjust based on screen size.
Test and Iterate: Tested the web page on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks great and functions well on all of them.
